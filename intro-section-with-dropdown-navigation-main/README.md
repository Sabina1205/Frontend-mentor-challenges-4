# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

## Overview

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Getting more comfortable with bulding menu with dropdown as well as transitioning between destop and mobile version, especially when it comes to menus.

### Continued development

I'm going to focus more on advanced CSS and writing better JS code.
